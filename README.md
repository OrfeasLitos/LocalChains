# LocalChains
Local Chains is a transaction ledger idea where each user needs to keep locally only transactions that are relevant to her
history. The only information stored on a distributed ledger is a trust network between users which will be used only when
conflicts appear on a user's local database to penalize the party that commited fraud. The construction is  based on a
combination of existing ideas, mainly on [Trust is Risk](https://github.com/decrypto-org/TrustIsRisk/blob/master/fc17.pdf) and
[Trust in Friends](https://github.com/decrypto-org/TrustIsRisk/blob/master/thesis-chrisp/decentralized-trust.pdf).
