\section{Formal Definitions}
  \begin{definition}[Trustworthy Transaction]
    Assume a transaction $A$ spent by $Bob$ is accepted by $Alice$ as valid and she includes
    it in her transaction DAG. This transaction precedes a transaction $B$ that pays to
    $Alice$'s address. Let $v$ be the value that $Alice$ can lose from $B$ if $A$ is
    double spent. $Alice$ deems $A$ trustworthy if $maxFlow\left(Alice, Bob\right) \geq v$
    on the global trust ledger.
