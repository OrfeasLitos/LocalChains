\section{Global Trust Ledger}
  Observe that in the previous example, it was never said that $Alice$ thinks that $Y_1$
  is \textit{trustworthy}; $Alice$ only perceives $Y_1$ as \textit{valid}. The lack of a
  global transaction ledger makes it possible that $Charlie$, $Dave$ or $Emily$ have
  double spent the new transactions $Alice$ learned about, thus $Alice$ has no reason to
  assume that she exclusively owns the coins at the output of transaction $C$. In order to
  be insured in case a previous transaction has been double spent, there has to be some
  kind of global, public commitment from each of the players in question (or someone
  vouching for them) that a refund will be given in case fraud is committed.
