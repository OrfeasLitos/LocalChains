\section{Global Trust Ledger}
  Observe that in the previous example, it was never said that $Alice$ thinks that $Y_1$
  is \textit{trustworthy}; $Alice$ only perceives $Y_1$ as \textit{valid}. The lack of a
  global transaction ledger makes it possible that $Charlie$, $Dave$ or $Emily$ have
  double spent the new transactions $Alice$ learned about, thus $Alice$ has no reason to
  assume that she exclusively owns the coins at the output of transaction $C$. In order to
  be insured in case a previous transaction has been double spent, there has to be some
  kind of global, public commitment from each of the players in question (or someone
  vouching for them) that a refund will be given in case fraud is committed.

  The global ledger consists of a directed graph of refund promises between players in
  case fraud is committed. In order for $Alice$ to be insured against the double spend of
  a transaction that lies before a UTXO she can spend, there must be a sufficiently heavy
  chain of insurances between her and each of the players that spent these preceding
  transactions. The following examples clarify the concept with regards to the
  trustworthiness of $Y_1$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{dot2tex}[outputdir=dot2tex/, file=goodTrust]
      \input{src/figures/goodTrust.dot}
    \end{dot2tex}
  \end{center}
  In this example, if any of $Charlie$, $Dave$ or $Emily$ double spend their money and
  $Alice$ finds out, then she will post the proof of fraud to the global ledger and
  $George$ will automatically refund her with the money that he is insuring the fraudster.
  Observe that there is enough insurance to cover for any individual fraud.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{dot2tex}[outputdir=dot2tex/, file=badTrust]
      \input{src/figures/badTrust.dot}
    \end{dot2tex}
  \end{center}
  In this case however, $Alice$ stands entirely uninsured against fraud by $Emily$ and
  only partly against fraud by $Charlie$. She is well insured against fraud by $Dave$.
